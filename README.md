# rot_algorithm

<p>Actually I was insired after watching this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9CBKGLVCME"> video </a>. I know that I am knowledgeless and lazy too. <br> I am that much lazy that I don't know the ascii values of all numbers. So what would happen if I got this problem or communication problem? So I thought that, I know how this algorithm works. While I know the algorithm I can find out all the rot value or text. <br><br></p>
